# CoreDataCloudKitDemo

My proof-of-concept for how to use CoreData with CloudKit

Under construction 30/Jul/15

Currently (IMO) acts as a better template for starting a Core Data project than Apple's standard Core Data template boilerplate. 

Aiming for a canonical example of how to build a TableView with UIFetchedResultsController using a ViewModel in Swift. Of course open for improvements!
